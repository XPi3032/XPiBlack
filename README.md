Hello and welcome!

I intend to help the developers of pi-hole and other ad-blocking, malware-blocking, tracker-blocking and more pieces of software to burn up the fishy areas of the Internet.

I have a couple categories for lists: Suspicious, advertising, malicious, pornography, even tracking, and more.
Not all of these lists are mine. The lists from ionized-bricks.pinetmedia.com are my own blocklists and are maintained by me personally.

# Whitelisting

Opposite of black: white. Curated whitelists are my specialty. I can assist you in the whitelist department [here](xpi3032.github.io/ionized-bricks/hosts/whitelisting/whitelist.txt).


### Support or Contact

Having trouble with the blocklists? [Contact support](https://support.pinetmedia.com) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.
