## Welcome!



I intend to help the developers of pi-hole and other ad-blocking, malware-blocking, tracker-blocking and more pieces of software to burn up the fishy areas of the Internet.

### My Lists

I have a couple categories for lists: Suspicious, advertising, malicious, pornography, and even tracking. 

## Malicious Lists // Domains Bearing the Bitter Fruit of Malware


- Bulleted
- List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/XPi3032/XPiBlack/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
